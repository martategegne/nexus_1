            <blockquote>
                <p>Focus on who you are rather than what others are saying about you. If you are cruel, but you are humble in the eyes of others, does it really have any meaning to your life? Working a lot on yourself and focusing on who you really are outweighs working hard to please others. So be yourself!</p>

                <p><q>If you say it takes me a... much time to finish this, for sure you will not get that thing done before the time approaches! i.e., if you say this thing takes a month to get done, it takes a month; a year, it takes a year!</q></p>

            <h2>My Educational Journey</h2>
            <p class="abbreviation-text">I have graduated at Dessie Special Boarding School <abbr title="Dessie Special Boarding School">DSBS</abbr> in 2023.</p>
            <p class="abbreviation-text">Throughout my educational journey, from the early days of elementary school to the momentous occasion of my Grade 12 graduation, I have experienced a triumphant path marked by growth and accomplishment. Each year brought new challenges and opportunities, shaping not only my knowledge but also my character. The support of teachers, friends, and family played a crucial role in this transformative experience, allowing me to overcome obstacles and celebrate milestones along the way. As I reflect on these years, I am filled with gratitude for the remarkable experiences that have prepared me for the future.</p>
