Marta: <blockquote>
focus on who you are than  what others are saying about you. if you are curel, but you are humble in the eye of others, does it really has any meaning to your life ? working alot on yourself and focusing  who you really are outweighs working  hard to please others. So be yourself!

Laurence: <q>If you say it takes me a ... much time  to finsh this, for sure you will not get that thing done before the time approaches! i.e if you say this thing takes a month to get done, it takes a month ; a year, it takes a year! </q>

I have graduated at Dessie Special Boarding School <abbr title="DSBS">DSBS</abbr> in 2023. <br>
Throughout my educational journey, from the early days of elementary school to the momentous occasion of my grade 12 graduation, I have experienced a triumphant path marked by growth and accomplishment. <br>
Each year brought new challenges and opportunities, shaping not only my knowledge but also my character. The support of teachers, friends, and family played a crucial role in this transformative <br>
experience, allowing me to overcome obstacles and celebrate milestones along the way. <br>
 As I reflect on these years, I am filled with gratitude for the remarkable experiences 
 that have prepared me for the future.
